# Automating-Electric-Energy-Purchases
The Tanzania Electric Supply Company Limited
(Tanesco) is a parastatal organization established in 1964 to generate, distribute and market electricity for domestic and industrial use. In recent years, Tanesco has been phasing out its old analog
meters and introducing new digital meters which enable customers to buy electricity according to
their energy needs. This approach has reduced Tanesco's costs considerably.
Currently, customers have several options to buy electricity. They can go to a vendor and pay
in cash, they can pay through their mobiles using either their bank account or using a service called
mobile money. When paying for electricity, several deductions are made on the paid amount.
These include an 18% VAT, a fixed monthly service charge (5000 Tanzanian Shillings), a 3% addition for the Rural Electricity Agency (REA), and a 1% addition for the Electricity and Water Utility Regulatory Authority (EWURA). The remaining amount after these deductions is used to
purchase energy (in kilowatt hours of electricity).
